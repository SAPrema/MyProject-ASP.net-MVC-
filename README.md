How ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework Work Together
Overview
In MyProject, we use ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework to build a robust web application. Here's a simple breakdown of how these technologies work together:

ASP.NET MVC
ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications. It helps organize your code and separate concerns:

Model:

What it is: Represents the data and business logic of your application.
Role in MyProject: Defines the data structures and handles data operations. In our case, this includes classes like Student, Pharmacy, etc.
Example: public class Student { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } }
View:

What it is: The UI component that displays data to the user.
Role in MyProject: Uses Razor syntax to generate HTML pages that users interact with. For example, a view might display a list of students.
Example: <table><tr><td>@student.Name</td></tr></table>
Controller:

What it is: Handles user requests, interacts with the model, and returns a view.
Role in MyProject: Processes user inputs, performs actions (like adding or editing data), and decides which view to show.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
public class StudentsController : Controller
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public StudentsController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        var students = await _context.Students.ToListAsync();
        return View(students);
    }
}
Entity Framework (EF)
Entity Framework is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that simplifies data access:

Entities:

What they are: Classes that represent the data in your application.
Role in MyProject: Each entity class maps to a table in the database. EF uses these classes to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Example: public class Student { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } }
DbContext:

What it is: A class that manages the connection to the database and tracks changes to the entities.
Role in MyProject: It provides methods to query and save data to the database.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }

    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }
}
Migrations:

What they are: A way to manage changes to the database schema over time.
Role in MyProject: EF Migrations help you update the database schema as your models change. This is crucial for keeping the database structure in sync with your code.
Example:
bash
Copy code
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
How They Work Together
Model Creation:

You define classes that represent your data. These classes are used by Entity Framework to create and manage database tables.
Data Access:

DbContext: You use DbContext to query and save data. This context is injected into controllers, where it is used to interact with the database.
Example: To get a list of students, you use _context.Students.ToListAsync().
Database Updates:

You use migrations to apply changes to the database schema. When you change your models, you create a new migration and update the database.
User Interaction:

Users interact with the application through views, which are generated by controllers. Controllers use DbContext to fetch or update data based on user actions.
Summary
ASP.NET MVC organizes the application into Models, Views, and Controllers, helping you manage the applicationâ€™s logic, presentation, and user interaction.
Entity Framework simplifies data access by mapping your data models to database tables and handling data operations through DbContext.
Together, they provide a structured approach to building web applications with a clear separation of concerns and efficient data management.
